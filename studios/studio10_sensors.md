# Sensors - the low tech way.

Did you know your phone has a bunch of different sensors?

## Phone sensors

Download Sensors Toolbox onto your phone to figure out what it can do:

## LiDAR.

Stay tuned for this exercise.

iPads come with LiDAR functionality these days. I'll take a LiDAR scan of my office and I'll show you how it works.

Then I'll send you the point cloud as an xyz file.

Now, go to this website http://lidarview.com/ and upload the file. Make sure the format is x y z - and hit "Render".

You'll see something like a point cloud - we hope!
