# Interoperability

This is our second python studio - and runs a little differently to last time.

We will still be using Jupyter Notebook, but this time we're accessing it from our own desktop, rather than Jupyter Hub! 

** Before Class **

1. *Install Anaconda* using their GUI or graphical user interface here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/ . Choose `64 bit Graphical Installer` for your operating system and follow the prompts. If you get stuck, further information is here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

2. *Download Folder* To access this studio, download the `interoperability_studio` folder. In it is a notebook file, two xml files, a .py file and a sound_sample wav file. Move the folder onto your desktop or into your documents or somewhere you can find it!

** In Class **

Open Anaconda Navigator. Then select the Jupyter Notebooks application. 

This will open up a browser window. Find your `Interoperability_Studio.ipynb` file and open it in the browser. 

Then refer to the notebook :-)

**For the #studios Slack:** 

**- Post a screenshot of a graph or an image!**
