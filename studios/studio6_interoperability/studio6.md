# Interoperability

This is our second python studio - and runs the same as last week!

We will be using Jupyter Notebook on Jupyter Hub.

To access this studio, download the Interoperability_Studio.ipynb file. This is a specific file extension (.ipynb) for Jupyter Notebooks. Python Scripts usually have the extension .py

Then, go to https://datahub.berkeley.edu/ and sign in using your UC Berkeley credentials.

Once inside the hub, on the top right, choose "Upload" and select your Interoperability_Studio.ipynb file. Once it's uploaded, double click and you'll see the notebook.

The instructions and explanations are enclosed within the notebook. If you hit "Run" in the tool bar across the top on the Code sections, you will see stuff happen.
