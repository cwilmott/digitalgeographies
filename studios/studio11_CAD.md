# CAD, or 3D modelling

So, this is a simple CAD studio, because I don't use it very much and when I do I don't often use these particular pieces of software.

Basically, we're just going to use two CAD programs - TinkerCAD and Clara.io - to experiment with different modes of doing CAD and to see how objects work with one another.

I'm providing the model from last week's LiDAR, which you can use and upload, here:

## TinkerCAD

TinkerCAD is an AutoDesk 3D printing CAD software that is VERY easy to use, we can start there.

1. Go to https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard and login using your Berkeley Google email address.
2. On the landing page, select "Create a new design".
3. Make some stuff. Import some stuff. Have fun!
4. Export as .obj (Export button is on the top left)

## Clara.io

Clara.io is better used for Animation and 3D Modelling than architectural CAD but it's free and in the browser and exports a bunch of different formats, so we'll use that.

Go to clara.io and sign up with your Berkeley account.

Create a new project.

Import your TinkerCAD object - File -> Import Object

See if you can figure out what's going on. Mess around. Make some stuff. When you get bored, export as .dae and again as .obj for good measure.
