## Set Up GitHub


The first thing you need to do is set up a GitHub account. GitHub is an industry-standard repository to host your code online, and maintain version control.
Most of the applications we are going to use have GitHub plugins that allow you to 'push' (or send) your code to GitHub and 'pull' (or download) other people's code from GitHub right from your desktop. For these labs, we won't be using any of these features, although once you're more confident, I encourage you to test them out. 
For these labs, we will largely be using GitHub as a place to hold our code and files, and as a web server for web-based applications that we will be making.

### Create a GitHub account

To join GitHub go to: https://github.com and select "Sign Up". Fill in your details and sign up.

To complete the process, verify your email address.

#### Create a new repository
Now, sign into your new GitHub account. This will take you to your account dashboard.
On the top left of the page, next to Repositories, select "New".

Name your repository 'digitalgeographies', set it to **Public** and select the Initalize this repository with a README option. Then select **Creating Repository...**

### Set Up GitHub Pages

Finally, once you're in your repository select the "Settings" tab. Scroll down to GitHub Pages and in Source, select the `master` branch option.

The confirmation screen will show the the web address of your new webpage!
