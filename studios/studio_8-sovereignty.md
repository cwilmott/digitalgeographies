# Studio 8: Licensing

Hold onto your hats for a boring, but oddly interesting, studio this week. No tech stuff, just some good old research into thinking about who owns your github.io site, and all its joys, and how you might want to licence it.

There are a bunch of different licences that intersect here. They can be broadly lumped into two classes: **permissive**, and **copyleft**.

> **Permissive**
>
> "A permissive license allows you to use the original program with little restrictions on how you choose to use the source code and re-share the software. It is also known as "non-copyleft" license and the main requirement is generally to include attribution of the original code to the original developers. A permissive license does not have reciprocity obligations so there is no assurance that the software will always remain free and public. With a permissive license, you can generally change and re-share someone else's program without disclosing the source code."

> **Copyleft**
>
>"Copyleft licenses require that anyone who releases a modified open source program must also release the source code for that program. This type of license generally allows you to change and re-share someone else's program as long as you also include your source code for others too. This is also known as the reciprocity obligation which states that you must release the original source code with all the rights to modify and distribute the code. When using a copyleft license you need to be careful as it might require you to expose intellectual property. Additionally, there are two types of copyleft licensesâ€“weak and strong.

There is a secret third class that's also important to talk about, which is have your lawyers sure up that no-one can take your stuff, and if they do, you'll sue them.

## 1. Licence your software/code

Phase 1 is thinking about how you'd like to licence your html/css/java code that you've created (we haven't made any software yet).

Here are the most common licences: what are the key differences?

GNU GPL - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html
MIT License - https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
Mozilla Public Licence - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/

Have a look at some others: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html

Now, you need to choose a licence that you'd like to copyright your code under (and future software you make in the class). Follow this here:
https://choosealicense.com/

Now, create a markdown page (readme.md) in the main folder of your Github.io website, and write your license there. Then save/commit.

Remember, markdown is another type of coding language - more info here: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/

## 2. Find, appropriate and relicense your content

Licensing content is different to licensing software. Software is the structure of your website, content is the stuff you put on it - any of your own writing or images, music etc...

Some common licenses are:

GNU FDL - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html
Creative Commons - https://creativecommons.org/
TK - https://localcontexts.org/licenses/traditional-knowledge-licenses/

Use the CC search engine to look for an image. Choose one - pay attention to the CC rules. Right click and Copy Image Address.

Then, go to https://pixlr.com/. Choose "Advanced Photo Editor", then "Load URL" on the bottom left, and paste the URL in.

Have some fun with the image. When you're bored, go File > Save and download the image.

Return to your github.io site. Create a folder called /images and save the image in there. Then, create a new page (or go to an old one), and see if you can work out how to put them image into the HTML. And remember, at the bottom, you need to copy and paste in your CC license. Choose your licence here: https://creativecommons.org/choose/

And that's it for today folks! 

If you'd like, I'm willing to hear arguments for making our own license in class. Let me know if you'd like to - but remember, I'm not a legal expert, so who knows if it will stick!
