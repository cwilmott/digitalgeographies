## Algorithms

So, this studio marks the first of our little python suite, and a chance to explore some algorithmic logics! 

We will be using Jupyter Notebook, since it's an easy way to see the progression through the script, rather than trying to deal with all the loops (oh so many loops!).
To do this, we're going to go on Jupyter Hub, which is cloud-based and used through a browser, so it doesn't require any downloads, and we don't need to worry too much about 
our poor computers.

To access this studio, download the `Algorithms_Studio.ipynb` file. This is a specific file extension (.ipynb) for Jupyter Notebooks. Python Scripts usually have the extension .py

Then, go to https://datahub.berkeley.edu/ and sign in using your UC Berkeley credentials. 

Once inside the hub, on the top right, choose "Upload" and select your `Algorithms_Studio.ipynb` file. Once it's uploaded, double click and you'll see the notebook.

The instructions and explanations are enclosed within the notebook. If you hit "Run" in the tool bar across the top on the Code sections, you will see stuff happen. And, don't forget to choose your own URL!


> If you'd like to use Notebook on your own desktop, I recommend downloading the Anaconda GUI, which will install both
