## Digital Geographies

Hi there! This is the Digital Geographies GitHub repository! 

You will find details of the Studios in the `studios` file, including the worksheets.

My github.io website is in the `website` folder.

(If you're interested, this file is written in markdown - or .md. It's really easy to use, and more details can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org).)
