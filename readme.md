## Digital Geographies

Hi there! This is the Digital Geographies GitHub repository! 

You will find details of the Studios in the [studios](https://cwilmott.github.io/digitalgeographies/studios/) file, including the worksheets. My website materials for the tutorials are in another repository called [website](https://github.com/cwilmott/website). 

(If you're interested, this file is written in markdown - or .md. It's really easy to use, and more details can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org).)
